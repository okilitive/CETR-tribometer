# CETR-tribometer

This project aims to merge the test data from CETR UMT-2 tribometer equipped with a linear wear module. UMT-2 is an old tribology test device manufactured by CETR, without further support and update, since Bruker's acquisition of CETR in 2011.  With the linear wear module, the wear testing data generated in multiple files, divided by switching wear direction, instead of entire reciprocating data file. To address this, a MATLAB script is provided to seamlessly merge all the linear wear data files into a unified dataset.
